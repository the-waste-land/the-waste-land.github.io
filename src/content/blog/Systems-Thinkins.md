## The goal-setting fashion
  Nowadays, almost everyone has goals to chase. We set goals to lose weight, to read more books, or to develop a new skill, among others. In our professional lives, we're also expected to meet various objectives such as KPIs, OKRs, and similar performance metrics.

  Goal-setting has become a common practice in our lives. Many people believe that if they want to achieve something, they need to set an ambitious goal and stay motivated to achieve it.

  However, I have observed that many people set goals only to forget about them after a while. Many others struggle to achieve their goals without feeling happiness in the process. Few people actually achieve their goals and go back to their old habits after a while.

## The problem with goals
  The problem with goals is that they will not really let you achieve what you want. Keep gaze on the goal, and you will not achieve it. Even worse, goals set you up to a dichotomy of success or failure. If you not achieve the goal, you feel like a failure. 

  Before you achieve the goal, you will not feel happy. So, we often sacrifice our happiness for the sake of achieving our goals, but never realize that doing the things that we want may make us happy. Reading a good book, keeping a healthy diet, or learning a new skill can be enjoyable activities. But we often forget about them because we are too focused on achieving our goals.
 
  We always sacrifice our happiness to chase our goals, telling ourselves that we will be successful and happy once we achieve them. The truth is that many of us (if not all) feel 
  happy and successful only for a short term, and go back to our old habits after a while.

## Willpower might not help
  Because we can't feel happy while chasing our goals, a common advice is to have more willpower. We are told that we need to be more disciplined, more focused, and more motivated to achieve our goals. 
  We are told that we need to work harder, to push ourselves more, and to never give up.

## Building a system
  Winners and losers have the same goals.
